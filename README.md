# UFO_Analysis
## Purpose 
The main purpose of the project is to provide more in-depth analysis of UFO sightings by allowing users to filter for multiple criteria at the same time. We will add filters for city, state, country, and shape in addition to date. 

## Results
- We will perform a demonstration on how you can filter the results in multiple ways.
- To filter the data we can see the filter table on left side of [screen](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1PoAC8xJzqteZjIOmeq5i5wWfJp0jW7Jz/view?usp=sharing) with available multiple filters. 
- If a user is looking for all the sightings with a circle shape, you can enter "circle" in the "Enter Shape" text box. After entering the text, users can either press "Enter button"  or "left click" with the mouse anywhere on the page. The webpage will automatically filter data and show [results](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1FxDSFpJg0qzMROgveXLaBMT1TICuOJF3/view?usp=sharing) with only "circle" shape . 
- Further to filter results user has entered the city "benton" in the "Enter City" text box. Upon applying this filter using the same way as the previous step, the webpage is now showing only one matching [result](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1Wbr7YcnEbODQ-ssWDIeCOONyBM5wWjHs/view?usp=sharing) with shape circle and city benton. 

## Summary
#### Drawbacks :
In this analysis there is a major drawback right now in this project, which is case-sensitivity. All the filters require text to be entered exactly as in the data rows; otherwise it will not show any results.
#### Recommendation :
- My first recommendation for this project is to solve the major drawbacks we have discussed to show users results no matter how the enter any text to filter on.
- Second, we can provide user with dropdown filter options to filter results. This will automatically remove the case-sensitive drawback in the analysis and users can filter data more easily and conveniently.
